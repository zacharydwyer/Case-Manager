# Case Contact Manager [Final Project]

## Developer(s)
Zachary Dwyer

## Description
This program manages cases, with an emphasis on what a Social Worker needs to be tracked. 

Each Case has a name, a set of Case Contacts (instances of contact with the case), and a set of Todos (things that need to still be done for the case). This app allows the user to manage these cases and their contacts/todos by adding, reading, updating and removing them.

## Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program
None known.
